1. Iustus Lipsius his first Booke of CONSTANCIE.

    _ Chapter. I. A Preface and introduction: Also a complaint of the troubles of the Lowe-cuntreyes.

    _ CHAPT. II. That traueilling into forreine countreyes is not auailable against the inwarde malladies of the minde: That it is a testimonie of them, but not a remedie against them, except onlie in steight and first motions of the affection.

    _ CHAPT. III. But deepe setled diseases of the mind are not taken away therby, no nor any whit mitigated: But rather reuiued. That it is the mind which is sicke in vs, which must seek remedie from Wisedome and Constancie.

    _ CHAPT. IIII. The definitions of Constancie, Patience, Right Reason, Opinion: also how Obstinacie differeth from Constancie, and Basenesse of mind from Patience.

    _ CHAPT. V. From whence Reason and Opinion doe spring. The force and effectes of them both. That one leadeth vnto Constancie: This other to Inconstancy.

    _ CHAPT. VI. The praise of Constancie: And an earnest exhortation thereunto.

    _ CHAPT. VII. What, and howe manie thinges doe disturbe Constancie. That outward good and euill thinges doe it. Euils are of two sortes, Publike and Priuate t Of these two, Publike euils seeme most greeuous and dangerous.

    _ CHAPT. VIII. A preuention against publike euils: But first of all, three affections are restrained. And of those three, particularly in this chapter is repressed a kind of vaine glorious dissimulation, wherby men that lament their owne priuate misfortunes, would seeme that they bewaile the common calamities.

    _ CHAPT. IX. The visarde of Dessimulation is more plainlie discouered, by examples. By the way mention is made of our true countrie. Also the malice of men reioycing at other mens harmes, when they them selues be without danger thereof.

    _ CHAPT. X. A complaint against the former sharpe reprehension of Langius: But he addeth that it is the part of a Philosopher so to speake freelie. Hee endeuoureth to •onfute the •ormer disputation speaking of dutie and loue to our countrey.

    _ CHAPT. XI. Here is confuted the second affection of too much loue to our countrey: which loue is falslie tearmed Pietie. Whence this affection springeth, and what is our countrie properlie and trulie.

    _ CHAPT. XII. The third affection bridled, which is Commiseration or pittying, being a vice. It is distinguished from Mercie. Howe, and how far forth we ought to vse it.

    _ CHAPT. XIII. The former impedimentes or lettes being remooued, wee come in good earnest to the extenuating or taking away of publike euils: which is assayed by foure principall arguments. Firste here is spoken of Prouidence, which is prooued to be in, and ouer all humane affaires.

    _ CHAPT. XIIII. That nothing is here done but by the becke of this Prouidence. That by it desolations come vpon men and citties: therefore we doe not the partes of good and godly men to murmure or mourne for them. Finally, an exhortation to obey God, against whome we striue vnaduisedly, and in vaine.

    _ CHAPT. XV. A passage to the second argument for Constancie, which is taken from necessitie. The force and violence thereof, This necessitie is considered two waies, And first in the thinges themselues.

    _ CHAPT. XVI. Examples of neessarie alteration, or death in the whole worlde. That heauen and the elements are changed, and shall perish: the like is to be seene in townes, prouinces and kingdomes, Finallie, that al things here do turne about the wheele: And that nothing is stable or constant.

    _ CHAPT. XVII. We come to that necessitie which is of destinie. First Destinie it selfe auouched. That there hath bene a generall consent therin of the common people, and wise men: But different in part. Howe manie waies Destinie hath bene taken among the Auncientes.

    _ CHAPT. XVIII. The three first kindes of destinie brieflie expounded. The definition or description of them all. The Stoickes sleightly and brieflie excused.

    _ CHAPT. XIX. The fourth and true kind of Destinie expounded. The name brieflie spoken of, it is lightly defined, and prooued to differ from Prouidence.

    _ CHAPT. XX. It is distinguished by foure Notes from Stoicall Destinie. Here is shewed more exactlie how it doth not enforce our wil: And also, that God is neither coadiutor, nor authour of euil.

    _ CHAPT. XXI. A Conclusion of the treatise of Destinie. An admonition that it is doubtfull and full of daunger: And must not curiouslie be searched. Lastlie, an earnest exhortation to imprint courage in our mindes thorough necessitie.

    _ CHAPT. XXII. Some doe seeke a cloake for their laizinesse in destiny: But that is taken away. Fate worketh by secondarie causes, therefore they must be applyed. How farre it behooueth vs to aide our countrie, and how not. The end of this first conference & book.

1. Iustus Lipsius, his second BOOKE, OF CONSTANCY.

    _ CHAPT. I. The occasion of renewing their •alke. The going vnto Langius his pleasant garden, and the commendation thereof.

    _ CHAPT. II. The praise of Gardens in generall. That the care of them is ancient, and from nature it selfe. That it was vsed by kinges and great personages. Finallie, the pleasure of them laid open before our eies; and my wish not vngodlie.

    _ CHAPT. II. Here is argued against some curious persons that do abuse gardens to vanitie and slouthfulnes: what is the true vse of them: that they are meet for wise men, and learned: And that wisdome her selfe was first bred and brought vp in them.

    _ CHAPT. IIII. An exhortation therefore vnto Wisedome. By it we come to Constancie. Young men are seriouslie admonished to ioyn the graue studie of Philosophy with those other studies that be more pleasant? and plausible.

    _ CHAPT. V. That wisedome is not obtained by wishing, but by working. A returning to the former talke of Constancie. That desire of learning is a good signe in youth.

    _ CHAPT. VI. The third argument for Constancy, taken from PROFIT. That calamities are good for vs, whether we respect their beginning, or end. For the originall of them is of God, who is eternallie and immutablie good: And therefore not the cause of anie euill.

    _ CHAPT. VII. Likewise, that the end of calamities tendeth alwaies to good, albeit they be effected often times by hurtful persons, and for harmes sake: But God breaketh and brideleth their force. And that all things are turned to our benefit. By the way is shewed why God vseth the instrument of wicked men, in inflicting calamities.

    _ CHAPT. VIII. It is here more distinctlie spoken of the endes themselues. They bee threefold. To whom euery of them doth agree. Then somewhat more at large touching Exercising, which profiteth good men more wayes than one: by strengthening, by proouing, by giuing example to others.

    _ CHAPT. IX. Of Chasticement, which is the second ende. It is prooued to be for our behoofe, two manner of waies.

    _ CHAPT. X. Finally that punishment it selfe is good and wholsome, in respect of God, of men, and of the party that is punished.

    _ CHAPT. XI. Of the fourth end, which is vncertaine to man. That it apperteineth eyther to the preseruation and safetie, Or els to the ornament and beautie of the whole World. Euery of these pointes largely handled.

    _ CHAPT. XII. An old and common obiection against Gods iustice, why punishments be not equal. Such inquiry is remoued from men. and declared to be vngodly.

    _ CAPT. XIII. Yet to certifie the Curious, three old obiections are aunswered. And firste touching euill men not punished. Wee proue they are repriued, and pardoned. And that either in respect of men themselues, or in regarde of Gods nature, which is slow to punish.

    _ CHAPT. XIIII. Then is it shewed that there be sundry kinds of punishmēts: And some of them hidden or inward, alwaies accompanying the wicked facts themselues, which vngodly men shall neuer escape. And they bee more greeuous than any outward.

    _ CHAPT. XV. That paines after this life are prepared for euill dooers. And most commonly also externall punishments. Confirmed by some notable examples.

    _ CHAPT. XVI. An answeare to the other obiection touching guiltles men. It is proued that all haue deserued punishment, for that al are offendors. And who they bee that doe offend more or lesse, can hardly or by no meanes be discerned by men. It is God onely that seeth thoroughly into faults, and therefore doth punish most iustlie.

    _ CHAPT. XVII. An answere to the thine obiection touching punishmentes translated or put off from one person to another. It is shewed by examples that the same is vsually doon among men. What is the cause wherefore God •iseth such translating of punishments from one to another. Also certeine other matters full of subtile curiositie.

    _ CAPT. XVIII. A Passage to the last place, which is of examples. It is shewed to be a matter profitable oftentimes to mix some things of sweete tast with sharper medicines.

    _ CAPT. XIX. That publike euills are not so grieuous as they seeme to bee; which firste is briefely proued by reason. For moste commonly wee feare the circumstances and adiuncts of thinges, more then the thinges themselues.

    _ CHAPT. XX. Now we come to comparison. And first of all the miserie of the Low-countries and of this our age, is exaggerated. That opinion is generallie confuted. And it is declared how that the natural disposition of men is prone to augment their owne griefes.

    _ CHAPT. XXI. The same is more properly and precisely confuted by comparison with the euils of olde time. First of the wars and maruellous desolation of the Iewes.

    _ CHAPT. XXII. Of the destructions of the Gertians and Romaines by warre. The great numbers of them that haue bene slain by certaine Captaines. Also the wasting of the new world. And the extreame miseries of captiuitie.

    _ CHAPT. XXIII. Most memorable examples of pestilence and famine in oulde times past. Also the intollerable tributes that haue bene then: And the rauenous pillings and powlings.

    _ CHAPT. XXIIII. Some strange examples of crueltie and butcherlie slaughters, surpassing all the mischieuous massacres of our time.

    _ CHAPT. XXV. The tyranny of our time is extenuated. Shewing that the same is a thing incident either to the nature, or malice of men. And that both externall and internall oppressions haue benne in old time.

    _ CHAPT. XXVI. Finallie, it is prooued that these euils are neither strange, nor newe: but at all times common to all people and nations. And therein some comfort is sought for.

    _ CHAPT. XXVII. The Conclusion of the whole conference: with a short admonition to the often repeating, and careful consideration therof.
